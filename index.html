        <p class="card_text">
          I love reading books, even though I don’t have much time in my daily
          routine. My favorite kind of literature is fiction, like The Lost
          Symbol by Dan Brown. I enjoy how these stories blend science,
          religion, and history, sparking curiosity and making us think beyond
          the obvious.

        <p class="card_text">
          My favorite hobby is training in weightlifting and jiu-jitsu. I
          believe that exercising the body helps calm the mind and improves
          focus on other daily activities, such as work and family. Besides
          that, training makes me feel healthier and more prepared to face
          life’s challenges.

          I really love traveling! I would love to see the whole world if I
          could. I’ve taken a few trips in the past, and they opened my mind to
          how amazing the world truly is! Besides that, traveling pushes us to
          learn a new language, a new recipe, and a new way of living. I believe
          my travels have been some of the best things I’ve ever done in my
          life.

        <p class="card_text">
          I love technology. With it, we can connect, exchange information
          faster, learn, help others, and do thousands of other things. I’ve
          always enjoyed understanding how things work, and that’s why this year
          I started taking my first steps in learning Web Development.
